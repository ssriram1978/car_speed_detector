car_speed_detector

This project is a community based project. 
It aims to do the following:
1. Demonstrate how to run an openly available image classification machine learning models on Intel® Movidius™ Neural Compute Stick.
2. Perform image classification and speed computation of a moving object (car).
3. Generate alarm (email) if the speed exceeds beyond the threshold limit.
